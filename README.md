# transient_weak_gravity

This Mathematica notebook contains all the numerical analysis carried out in the article “Transient weak-gravity in scalar-tensor theories” by M. Wittner, G. Laverda, O. Piattella, L. Amendola (arxiv: 2003.08950). The notebook is divided into three parts:

- Chapter 1 contains the preliminary definitions of all the variables and functions appearing in the conformal-coupling model under study. It also defines the four versions of the model according to the value of the conformal-coupling parameter beta_c. 

- Chapter 2 contains the solutions to the background equations for all the cases (lambdaCDM, the uncoupled case and the four conformal-coupling cases). For the conformal-coupling model, boundary conditions are set so that the present-day value of cosmological densities correspond to the measured values. To achieve this, a shooting method is adopted. Multiple plots at the end of the chapter help in comparing the features of the various models. 

- Chapter 3 contains the full analysis of the perturbation equations. Firstly, the perturbation equations are solved in their exact form. Subsequently, the quasi-static-approximated set of perturbation equations is solved. The plots in the final sections show the time-intervals when the QSA solutions match the exact solutions. Finally, by comparing the Y function in the QSA regime and in the weak-gravity regime it is possible to infer that there exist periods of weakened gravitational interactions caused by a negative Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential.

Further details on the method adopted are included at the beginning of each chapter. The last plots generated are the ones that appear in the article.

The full evaluation of the notebook takes around 4 minutes on an average laptop.

The use of this code is free provided that the article “Transient weak-gravity in scalar-tensor theories” (arxiv: 2003.08950) and its authors M. Wittner, G. Laverda, O. Piattella, L. Amendola are cited.

This notebook has been created by Giorgio Laverda in collaboration with M. Wittner, O. Piattella and L. Amendola.
